# DSC-7
DSC (Arduino-based Version)
These are the sourece files, as well as EXE file for the VB6 application that runs on the PC computer.
I have used it with Windows version up to and including Windows 7. I don't know if it works on 
Windows 8 as I have no Win 8 computers. I do know it does NOT work on Windows 10, due to the fact that the 
Arduino USB driver, which works OK with the Arduiono IDE, does NOT work with Visual Basic 6 running under Win 10.
I have had this issue personally, and seen other people report it on forums etc., with no solution avaialable as of the writing of this Readme
